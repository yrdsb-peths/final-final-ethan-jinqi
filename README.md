# Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Minesweeper game built using Java and Greenfoot.
The player uncovers tiles on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. Numbers on tiles indicate how many mines are adjacent. The goal is to uncover all non-mine tiles without clicking a mine.

The game supports multiple difficulty modes, including a custom mode where the player chooses the grid size and number of mines.
